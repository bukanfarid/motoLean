# motoLean
### WWDC 2023 Swift Student Challenge 

motoLean is an application specifically designed for motorcycle riders. Some motorcycle riders enjoy taking turns at high speeds, requiring them to tilt their motorcycles as much as possible.

Therefore, motoLean is created to record their journeys, starting from the beginning and end time, the tilt angle of the motorcycle at each turn, and also detecting the direction of the turn. motoLean utilizes accelerometer sensors to obtain these tilt angle measurements.

**Used Technologies**: SwiftUI, CoreMotion

## Installation & Usage

The app will be published on the App Store in the future. However, until then, you can clone the repository and run it on your iPad using the Swift Playgrounds app. To open the project in Xcode or Swift Playgrounds, you will need to add ".swiftpm" to the enclosing folder after cloning it from GitHub.
